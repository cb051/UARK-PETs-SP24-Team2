### Approach
We consider three poisoning approaches on two different models, Logistic Regression and DistilBERT. The poisoning approaches are:
1. Label Manipulation
2. Token Replacement
3. Trigger Phrases

We use the last method to implement a Backdoor Attack. 

### About Files
- ```backdoor_logistic_regression.ipynb``` implements a backdoor attack via poisoning in a logistic regression model.
- ```DistilBERT.ipynb``` implements the label manipulation and token replacement poisoning attacks in a DistilBERT model.
- ```logistic_regression.ipynb``` implements the label manipulation and token replacement poisoning attacks in a logistic regression model.
